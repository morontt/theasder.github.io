Recommendations for Non-Academic Learnings

Work on project outside of the classroom.
Notes: Create and maintain a website, build your own server, or build a robot.
Online Resources: Apache List of Projects, Google Summer of Code, Google Developer Group

Work on a small piece of a large system (codebase), read and understand existing code, track down documentation, and debug things.
Notes: Github is a great way to read other people’s code or contribute to a project.
Online Resources: Github, Kiln

Work on project with other programmers.
Notes: This will help you improve your ability to work well in a team and enable you to learn from others.

Practice your algorithmic knowledge and coding skills
Notes: Practice your algorithmic knowledge through coding competitions like CodeJam or ACM’s International Collegiate Programming Contest.
Online Resources: CodeJam, ACM ICPC

Become a Teaching Assistant
Notes: Helping to teach other students will help enhance your knowledge in the subject matter.

Internship experience in software engineering
Notes: Make sure you apply for internships well in advance of the period internships take place. In the US, internships take place during the summer, May-September, and applications are usually open several months in advance.
